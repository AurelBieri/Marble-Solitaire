# Marble-Solitaire
I've seen a YouTube video about Algorithms and wanted to make a small project with one.
In this Project, I try to solve a Marble-Solitaire with a genetic algorithm. I tried to use as less means of help as possible and try to solve the Problem myself.

*I will finish the project in the future.
